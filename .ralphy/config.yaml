# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Before writing code, read at least two relevant reference implementations from .references/ to understand design trade-offs."
  - "For each design topic, explicitly record which .references directories/files were consulted."
  - "Use Go idioms and keep APIs minimal and explicit."
  - "Ensure all new code is covered by unit tests."
  - "Adhere to existing coding style and conventions."
  - "Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principles."
  - "Maximize code reuse whenever possible."
  - "Follow language-specific idioms and patterns defined in the project"
  - "Maintain consistent import organization and package patterns"
  - "Follow established naming conventions (variables, functions, types, files)"
  - "Apply proper error handling patterns as defined by the project"
  - "Respect module boundaries and single responsibility at package level"
  
# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
boundaries:
  never_touch:
    - ".references/**"
